# TileDB-VCF

TileDB-VCF is a library for efficient storage and retrieval of genomics variant-call data. With it, you can easily ingest large amounts of variant-call data from the VCF (or BCF) format into a 2D sparse TileDB array that allows for highly compressed storage and efficient, parallelized queries on the variant data. The motivation and idea behind storing VCF data in a 2D sparse array is described in our [Genomics use case docs](https://docs.tiledb.com/main/use-cases/genomics).
